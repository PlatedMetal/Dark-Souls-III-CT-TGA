## Latest Release
Table: [v3.2.0](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Dark-Souls-III-CT-TGA/releases/latest) | [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md)  
Cheat Engine: [7.2 or newer](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/releases)  
Game: App ver. 1.15.1 | Regulation ver. 1.35

## How to use
### Cheat Table (Windows)
1. Download and install Cheat Engine either from [Github](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/releases) or from its [website](https://cheatengine.org/) 
2. Download the [Cheat Table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Dark-Souls-III-CT-TGA/releases)
3. Unpack the .CT file anywhere that *isn't a Windows protected folder*, a recommendation would be your **My Cheat Tables** folder (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Cheat Tables`). The default downloads folder is protected and potentially causes problems with one of the features in the table.
4. Run the game via Steam 
5. Load the .CT file directly via double-click or selecting it and pressing enter, or launch Cheat Engine and load the .CT file via File->Load or by clicking on the folder icon
6. Activate the "Open" script by ticking its box
### Cheat Table (Linux)
I expect you to already have Steam, Wine, Proton, and the game installed
1. Launch the game at least once via Steam to have your wine prefix set up
2. Install [protonhax](https://github.com/jcnils/protonhax) (On Arch you should grab [protonhax-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/protonhax-git))
3. Download and install the **Windows** version of Cheat Engine from [Github](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/releases) or from its [website](https://cheatengine.org/) using **Wine**
4. Download the [Cheat Table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Dark-Souls-III-CT-TGA/releases) 
5. Unpack the .CT file anywhere, a recommendation would be somewhere you can easily find within the wine prefix created for the game (e.g. `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/374320/pfx/drive_c/`)
6. In Steam, set the game's launch options to `protonhax init %command%`
7. Run the game via Steam
8. Run Cheat Engine via `protonhax run 374320 /path/to/Cheat\ Engine.exe` in your terminal of choice or put it in a shell script (replace `/path/to/` with your actual path to where you installed CE)
9. Load the .CT file via File->Load or by clicking on the folder icon
10. Activate the "Open" script by ticking its box
